# RAG Knowledge System Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Build a retrieval-augmented generation system that lets Claude answer youth-athlete nutrition questions only from approved, cited knowledge files — using TF-IDF retrieval, deterministic Python calculations, and the existing Anthropic API key.

**Architecture:** Markdown knowledge files in `/knowledge/` are ingested into two new SQLite tables (`knowledge_items`, `knowledge_chunks`). At query time, TF-IDF cosine similarity retrieves the top relevant chunks, deterministic calculation functions provide any numeric values, and Claude answers only from the provided context with mandatory citations.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.12, FastAPI, SQLite (existing), scikit-learn (TF-IDF), PyYAML, Anthropic SDK (existing), pytest

## Daily Iron Requirements (RDA)

The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for iron is established by the Food and Nutrition Board at the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies.

- Males age 9–13: **8 mg/day**
- Males age 14–18: **11 mg/day**
- Females age 9–13: **8 mg/day**
- Females age 14–18: **15 mg/day**

Female athletes aged 14–18 need almost double what males need because of menstrual losses. The ACSM notes that approximately 52% of female athletes show signs of iron deficiency, which directly impacts endurance, speed, and the ability to recover between sessions.

## Why Iron Matters for Soccer Athletes

Iron is the key mineral for oxygen delivery. Without enough iron, red blood cells cannot carry adequate oxygen to working muscles. This shows up as:
- Unexplained fatigue during practice
- Slower recovery between games
- Reduced sprint speed in the second half

## Daily Magnesium Requirements (RDA)

- Males age 9–13: **240 mg/day**
- Males age 14–18: **410 mg/day**
- Females age 9–13: **240 mg/day**
- Females age 14–18: **360 mg/day**

Magnesium supports muscle function, sleep quality, and energy production. Athletes who sweat heavily (high-intensity soccer training) lose magnesium and need consistent dietary intake to maintain performance.

## Best Food Sources

**Iron-rich foods:**
- Lean beef and chicken thighs
- Lentils and black beans
- Fortified cereal
- Spinach (pair with vitamin C to improve absorption)
- Tofu

**Key tip:** Eating iron with vitamin C (orange juice, bell peppers, strawberries) significantly increases absorption. Avoid eating iron-rich foods with calcium-rich foods at the same meal — they compete for absorption.

**Magnesium-rich foods:**
- Pumpkin seeds and almonds
- Black beans and edamame
- Brown rice and whole grain bread
- Bananas and avocado
- Dark chocolate (70%+)

## Warning Signs to Watch

If an athlete shows persistent fatigue, paleness, or shortness of breath during normal activity, these may be signs of iron-deficiency anemia. This requires testing by a medical professional — do not attempt to self-diagnose or supplement without guidance.

## Daily Hydration Targets by Event Type

Daily fluid needs vary based on activity level and environmental conditions.

- **Rest day:** 64–72 oz (8–9 cups)
- **Practice day:** 72–80 oz (9–10 cups)
- **Game day:** 80–88 oz (10–11 cups)
- **Tournament day:** 88–96 oz (11–12 cups)

These targets assume moderate temperatures. Add 8–16 oz per day on hot days (above 85°F).

## The 2% Rule

Research shows that losing just 2% of body weight through sweat measurably slows reaction time and reduces aerobic capacity. For a 120 lb athlete, that is only 2.4 lbs of fluid. By the time an athlete feels thirsty, they are already at or near this threshold.

**Practical rule: drink before you are thirsty.**

## Game-Day Hydration Protocol

- Night before: drink 16–24 oz water with dinner
- Morning of game: 16 oz with breakfast
- 2 hours before kickoff: 16 oz
- 30 minutes before kickoff: 8 oz
- Every 15–20 minutes during game: 4–8 oz
- Within 30 minutes after game: 16–24 oz (start recovery)

## Electrolytes

Plain water is sufficient for practices under 60 minutes in moderate weather. For games, tournaments, or hot-weather practices over 60 minutes, electrolytes matter:

- **Sodium** replaces what is lost in sweat and helps the body retain fluid
- **Potassium** supports muscle contraction and prevents cramps
- **Natural options:** coconut water, banana + water, orange slices at halftime

**Avoid:** sports drinks with Red Dye 40 or Yellow Dye 5 (artificial colors). Choose natural electrolyte sources or plain coconut water.

## Signs of Dehydration

Mild: dark yellow urine, dry mouth, reduced energy
Moderate: headache, dizziness, muscle cramps
Severe: fainting, confusion, inability to produce tears — this is a medical emergency. Stop all activity and seek medical help immediately.

## Urine Color Guide

- Pale yellow (lemonade color): well hydrated ✓
- Dark yellow (apple juice): drink more water now
- Orange or brown: severely dehydrated — stop activity

## The Pre-Practice Meal Window

Eating at the right time before practice or a game is as important as what you eat. The goal is to fuel muscles without causing stomach discomfort during high-intensity activity.

**2.5–4 hours before:** Full meal (carbs + protein + moderate fat)
**30–60 minutes before:** Light snack only (easy-digest carbs, no fat or fiber)
**Less than 30 minutes before:** Nothing new — stick to small sips of water

## What to Eat — Full Pre-Practice Meal (2.5–4 hrs before)

Focus: HIGH carbohydrates, moderate protein, LOW fat and fiber

Good choices:
- Pasta or rice with grilled chicken and light sauce
- Whole grain toast with eggs and orange juice
- Oatmeal with banana and a glass of milk
- Turkey sandwich on white bread with fruit

Avoid before practice: fried foods, large amounts of cheese, beans, raw vegetables (high fiber slows digestion)

## What to Eat — Pre-Game Snack (30–60 min before)

Focus: FAST carbohydrates only — no protein, no fat, minimal fiber

Good choices:
- Banana
- Toast with honey
- Rice cakes
- Applesauce pouch
- Handful of crackers

**Familiar foods only on game day.** Never try a new food on game day — even healthy foods can cause unexpected stomach problems.

## Game-Day Breakfast (3+ hours before kickoff)

This is your last full meal before the game. Make it count:
- High carbs (pasta, pancakes, bagel, oatmeal)
- Moderate protein (eggs, Greek yogurt)
- Low fat and low fiber — keep digestion simple
- Familiar foods only

## The Night Before a Game

The night-before dinner is actually the most important game-day meal. Muscle glycogen — your primary fuel for a 90-minute game — is loaded 24–48 hours before kickoff.

Best pre-game dinner: pasta or rice with protein (chicken, fish) and vegetables. No heavy cream sauces or fried foods.

## Carbohydrate Targets by Event Type

The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and ACSM recommend:
- Rest days: 4–5 g carbs per kg body weight
- Practice days: 6–8 g carbs per kg body weight
- Game days: 8–10 g carbs per kg body weight
- Tournament days: 10–12 g carbs per kg body weight

## The 30-Minute Recovery Window

Within 30 minutes after a game or hard practice, muscles are primed to absorb nutrients for repair and glycogen replenishment. This window is non-negotiable for athletes who train or compete multiple times per week.

**Miss this window → slower recovery → worse performance in the next session.**

## The 3:1 Carb-to-Protein Rule

The ACSM-endorsed recovery ratio is approximately 3 grams of carbohydrates for every 1 gram of protein. This combination:
1. Rapidly restores muscle glycogen (carbs)
2. Triggers muscle protein synthesis (protein)
3. Reduces muscle breakdown and soreness

**The gold standard recovery snack: chocolate milk + banana**
- Chocolate milk provides roughly 3:1 carb-to-protein ratio naturally
- A banana adds fast carbohydrates
- Easy to carry and consume immediately after a game

Other good options:
- Greek yogurt + fruit + granola
- Turkey wrap with fruit juice
- Smoothie with milk, banana, and nut butter

## Bedtime Casein for Muscle Repair

On game days and hard training days, eating a casein-rich snack before bed extends muscle repair through the night. Casein is a slow-digesting protein.

Best bedtime snack options:
- Cottage cheese with a little honey or fruit (25–30g casein)
- Greek yogurt (20g protein)

This is especially important for athletes with two games in two days or back-to-back training sessions.

## Full Recovery Meal (1–2 hours after game)

After the immediate snack, a full recovery meal completes the process:
- Carbohydrates: rice, pasta, potatoes (restore glycogen)
- Protein: chicken, fish, eggs (repair muscle)
- Vegetables: anti-inflammatory foods that reduce soreness
- Fluids: continue hydrating until urine returns to pale yellow

## Iron Focus on Recovery Days

Rest days and recovery days are the best time to prioritize iron-rich meals. When the body is not in high-performance mode, iron absorption is more efficient. Include iron-rich foods (lentils, lean beef, fortified cereal) at recovery meals.

## Game-Day Eating Schedule

### Night Before (most important meal of the week)
High-carb dinner to load muscle glycogen. Glycogen loading takes 24–48 hours, so tonight's pasta matters more than tomorrow's breakfast.
- Pasta or rice with lean protein
- Bread, fruit, milk
- Avoid heavy sauces, fried food, large amounts of fat

### Morning of Game (3–4 hours before kickoff)
Last full meal. High carbs, moderate protein, low fat and fiber.
- Oatmeal with banana and milk
- Bagel with peanut butter and OJ
- Pancakes with eggs and fruit
- No new or unusual foods

### Pre-Game Snack (30–60 minutes before kickoff)
Fast carbs only. Keep it small. Nothing heavy.
- Banana
- Toast with honey
- Rice cakes
- Sports gel or applesauce pouch

### Halftime
Quick refuel for the second half:
- Orange slices or banana
- 8–12 oz water or natural sports drink
- No heavy foods — keep it light

### Post-Game (within 30 minutes)
Start recovery immediately:
- Chocolate milk + banana (gold standard)
- 16–20 oz water or electrolyte drink

### Dinner (1–2 hours post-game)
Full recovery meal:
- Rice or pasta + lean protein + vegetables
- Continue hydrating
- Iron-rich foods if possible

## What to Avoid on Game Day

- High-fat foods (fried chicken, pizza, cheese-heavy dishes) — slow digestion, cause sluggishness
- High-fiber foods right before game (beans, raw vegetables, whole bran) — GI distress risk
- Energy drinks — not appropriate for youth athletes; caffeine disrupts sleep and hydration
- New foods — always eat familiar foods on game day

## Tournament Day (Multiple Games)

For tournaments with 2+ games, the refuel window between games is shorter than a normal recovery window. Prioritize:
1. Chocolate milk or recovery drink immediately after game 1
2. Light carb snack 60 min before game 2
3. Higher carb dinner the night before
4. Electrolytes throughout the day

## What Good Fueling Looks Like Across a Week

Nutrition for youth athletes is not about perfection on one day — it is about consistent habits across the whole week. The goal is to build patterns, not to get a perfect score on game day.

## Weekly Check-In Questions

At the end of each week, review these five areas:

**1. Carbohydrates:** Did you eat carbs at most meals? (Rice, pasta, bread, oats, fruit, potatoes)
**2. Protein:** Did you eat protein 3–4 times per day? (Eggs, chicken, beef, fish, dairy, beans)
**3. Hydration:** Was your urine pale yellow most of the day?
**4. Iron and calcium:** Did you eat iron-rich and calcium-rich foods on most days?
**5. Recovery meals:** Did you eat within 30 minutes after each hard practice or game?

## What a Strong Fuel Week Looks Like

- Carbs at every meal
- Protein 3–4x per day
- 8–10 cups water daily
- Recovery snack within 30 min of every hard session
- Pre-game meal 2.5–4 hours before every game
- Iron-rich food at least once per day (especially for female athletes)
- Calcium-rich food at least twice per day (milk, yogurt, fortified foods)

## Warning Signs of Underfueling

If an athlete experiences these patterns consistently, nutrition may be insufficient:
- Fatigue that does not improve with rest
- Getting sick more often than usual
- Slower sprint times or reduced endurance over weeks
- Muscle cramps occurring frequently
- Difficulty concentrating in school
- Mood changes, irritability, or difficulty sleeping

These symptoms warrant a conversation with a sports dietitian. Do not attempt to self-diagnose.

## Building Better Habits

The most effective nutrition change for youth athletes is usually the simplest: **eat more consistently throughout the day.** Long gaps without food (more than 4–5 hours) deplete energy stores and impair afternoon practice performance.

Aim for meals or snacks every 3–4 hours during the day, with the largest carb portions timed around training and competition.

## When to Stop and Seek Medical Help Immediately

These situations require stopping all activity and contacting a medical professional or emergency services:

- **Fainting or loss of consciousness** during or after exercise
- **Chest pain or pressure** during exercise
- **Severe dizziness or inability to stand** after activity
- **Vomiting that does not stop** after exercise
- **Dark brown or orange urine** — possible severe dehydration or muscle breakdown
- **Signs of heat stroke:** hot/dry skin, confusion, no sweating despite heat

Call 911 or go to an emergency room for any of these.

## Eating and Eating Disorders — When to Seek Help

FuelUp provides food education guidance only. The following signs may indicate a serious health issue that requires a qualified professional:

- Athlete is consistently avoiding entire food groups (not due to allergy)
- Significant unintentional weight loss over weeks
- Athlete expresses extreme fear of gaining weight
- Athlete is restricting food intake to lose weight for sport
- Signs of binge-purge behaviors
- Athlete reports feeling dizzy, cold all the time, or losing hair

If you observe any of these signs, please consult a registered dietitian (RD), the athlete's physician, or a mental health professional. **FuelUp is not equipped to address eating disorders.** Early intervention is critical and effective.

## Iron Deficiency Anemia — When to Test

These symptoms together may indicate iron-deficiency anemia, which requires a blood test to confirm:
- Persistent fatigue not explained by training load
- Paleness (especially gums and inner eyelids)
- Shortness of breath during activities that were previously easy
- Rapid heartbeat at rest
- Headaches

Diagnosis requires a blood test (serum ferritin + hemoglobin). Do not supplement iron without a confirmed diagnosis — excess iron can be harmful.

## Overtraining and Relative Energy Deficiency (RED-S)

RED-S (previously called the Female Athlete Triad) occurs when an athlete does not eat enough to support both training and normal body functions. Signs include:
- Stress fractures or frequent injury
- Missed or irregular menstrual cycles (female athletes)
- Declining performance despite consistent training
- Frequent illness or slow healing

This requires evaluation by a sports medicine physician and registered dietitian. FuelUp can support healthy fueling habits but cannot treat RED-S.

## What FuelUp Can and Cannot Do

**FuelUp provides:** Educational food guidance, meal timing recommendations, hydration targets, and evidence-based nutrition information for healthy youth athletes.

**FuelUp cannot:** Diagnose medical conditions, treat eating disorders, prescribe supplements, replace a doctor or registered dietitian, or provide medical advice.

When in doubt, consult a qualified professional.

- [ ] **Step 2: Register router in `api/main.py`**

Open `api/main.py`. Add the import and router registration:

```python
# In the imports line, add:
from api.routes import parents, athletes, events, nutrition, meals, recipes, analysis, reports, notifications, meal_plans, today, water, knowledge

# After the water router line, add:
app.include_router(knowledge.router, prefix="/api/knowledge", tags=["15. Knowledge Base"])
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Restart the server and smoke test**

```bash
pkill -f "uvicorn api.main" 2>/dev/null; sleep 1
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8000 &
sleep 3
curl -s -H "X-Admin-Key: fuelup-admin" http://localhost:8000/api/knowledge/ | python3 -m json.tool | head -30
```

Expected: JSON array of knowledge items.

- [ ] **Step 4: Test the /ask endpoint**

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/knowledge/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "how much iron does a teenage girl need?", "athlete_id": 1}' \
  | python3 -m json.tool
```

Expected: JSON with `answer`, `citations` (non-empty), `calculation`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add api/routes/knowledge.py api/main.py
git commit -m "feat(knowledge): add admin API routes and /ask public endpoint"
```

---

## Task 10: Run all tests and final verification

- [ ] **Step 1: Run the full test suite**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pytest tests/test_knowledge.py -v
```

Expected output (all should pass):
```

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify the ingest script with status**

```bash
python scripts/ingest_knowledge.py --status
```

Expected: 7 approved rows in the table.

- [ ] **Step 3: Final commit**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(knowledge): RAG knowledge system complete — 7 files, TF-IDF retrieval, deterministic calcs, Claude RAG, admin API, 22 tests"
```

## How to Add New Knowledge Content (Ongoing)

1. Create `knowledge/your_topic.md` using the frontmatter template from Task 3
2. Set `review_status: "draft"` while writing
3. When ready: change to `review_status: "approved"`
4. Run: `python scripts/ingest_knowledge.py --file knowledge/your_topic.md`
5. Verify: `python scripts/ingest_knowledge.py --status`

To replace/update existing content:
1. Increment `version` in the frontmatter
2. Run ingest again — it upserts (replaces chunks for that slug)

To retire old guidance:
```bash
python scripts/ingest_knowledge.py --retire knowledge/old_guide.md
```
