"""
Action Hub — an operations-oriented dashboard: a live "needs attention" feed
built from REAL signals (red System Health checks, at-risk families, this-week
problem reports), plus real metric cards, a weekly-activity heatmap, and the
health summary.

Grounded adaptation of the "Mission Control" spec: no world map (we store no
locations), no retry/notify remediation (no such endpoints) — attention items
carry a "View" action that navigates to the relevant screen. Reuses existing
data functions (db_metrics, funnel_steps, get_health_snapshot) — no new source
of truth.
