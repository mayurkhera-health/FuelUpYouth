Support / problem reports.

POST /api/support/report — persist a user-submitted problem report (with an
optional screenshot) and email the team. The report is saved to the DB and a
201 is returned REGARDLESS of email outcome: email is best-effort so a delivery
failure never loses the report or fails the request.
