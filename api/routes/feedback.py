"""
Feature requests ("What's Coming" → Suggest a Feature).

POST /api/feedback/feature-request — persist a user-submitted feature suggestion
and email the team. The row is saved and a 200 is returned REGARDLESS of email
outcome: email is best-effort so a delivery failure never loses the suggestion
or fails the request (same pattern as routes/support.py).
