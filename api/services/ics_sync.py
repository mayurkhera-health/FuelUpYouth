"""
Recurring calendar sync — BYGA + PlayMetrics .ics feeds.

A background APScheduler job (`run_calendar_sync_tick`, registered in api/main.py)
fetches every athlete's stored .ics subscription URL(s) and reconciles the feed
into the `events` table: INSERT new games/practices, UPDATE ones whose time or
place changed, and DELETE future ones that vanished from the feed (a cancelled or
removed game). Every mutation calls `on_event_added_or_changed` so the fuel-window
engine regenerates that day's Today / Meal-Plan windows — exactly like the manual
POST/PUT/DELETE /events routes do.

Design mirrors the client-side importer (mobile utils/icsImport.ts) so a synced
event classifies identically to a hand-imported one, with two server-only guards:

  * "Past" is judged in each event's own TZID (Option 1A) with a 24h buffer, since
    a background job has no client timezone and Fly runs UTC.
  * The DELETE phase only removes FUTURE events (event_date >= cutoff) whose source
    matches the feed, and is skipped entirely when a fetch fails or the feed has no
    VEVENTs — so a transient/empty feed can never wipe the athlete's schedule, and
    manual events (source='manual') are never touched.
