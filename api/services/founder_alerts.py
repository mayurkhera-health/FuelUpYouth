"""
Founder alerting channel — shared push-first / email-fallback delivery to the
founder's phone. Extracted from health_alerts.py so both the System Health
alerts and the beta login alerts send through ONE mechanism (no duplicated Expo
integration).

Channel: Expo push to ADMIN_ALERT_PARENT_ID's registered device(s); if the push
send fails/raises or there are no tokens, fall back to email (ADMIN_ALERT_EMAIL).
Email fires ONLY as fallback, never duplicated. Everything here is best-effort
and must never raise into a caller (a broken alert can't break a real request).
