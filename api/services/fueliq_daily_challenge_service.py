"""
Fuel IQ Daily Challenge — a single global myth-style challenge published per
calendar day, replacing the old per-athlete Myth Buster pool it grew out of.
Not personalized and not rotated per athlete: every athlete sees the same
`fueliq_daily_challenges` row on a given day (spec decision — no sibling
comparison concerns since there's nothing athlete-specific to compare).

PST is the server's reference clock for "what day is it" — matches the fixed
push-notification time, deliberately not each athlete's own local timezone.

Deliberately independent of the rest of Fuel IQ (spec decision, not an
oversight): completing the Daily Challenge never touches
fueliq_athlete_progress.score — it can't move an athlete's Rank or unlock a
Level. It has its own points (informational — shown on the reward moment
only) and its own streak (fueliq_daily_challenge_streak, NOT
fueliq_streak.py's lesson-activity streak). The streak also has no freeze-
token forgiveness — a missed day always resets it, on purpose: the whole
point of "Daily" is the same-day urgency.
