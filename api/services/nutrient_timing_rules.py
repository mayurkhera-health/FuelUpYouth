TIMING_BRIEF = """
FUELING2WIN NUTRIENT TIMING BLUEPRINT (IOC/AAP/ACSM — authoritative for all meal planning):

WINDOW 1 — GAS TANK MEAL (3–4 hrs before): High complex carbs + moderate lean protein + low fat/fiber.
Reason: Gastric emptying takes 2–4 hrs. Exercising before completion causes cramping and performance loss.

WINDOW 2 — TOP-OFF SNACK (30–60 min before): Simple carbs only — near-zero fat or fiber.
Reason: Fat/fiber causes GI distress in the activity window.

WINDOW 3 — DURING EVENT:
  < 75 min: Water only. No exogenous carbs needed.
  ≥ 75 min OR tournament: 30–60 g simple carbs per hour + electrolytes.
  Hydration: 4–8 oz every 15 minutes throughout.

WINDOW 4 — RECOVERY (within 30 min after event): 3:1 to 4:1 carbs:protein ratio.
Gold standard: Low-fat chocolate milk. Reason: Insulin sensitivity is peak — this is the glycogen
resynthesis and muscle repair window (IOC Bergeron et al. 2015). Missing this window significantly
delays recovery.

BEDTIME CASEIN (on active days): 30–40 g casein (cottage cheese / Greek yogurt) before sleep.
Reason: Overnight muscle repair proven in adolescent athletes.

CORE RULES: Never recommend supplements for under-18. Never skip breakfast. Calcium 1,300 mg/day.
Iron 15 mg/day for girls (52% of female teen athletes are deficient).
