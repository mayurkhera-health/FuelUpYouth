"""
Best-effort transactional email via Gmail SMTP (stdlib smtplib — no extra deps).

Reads GMAIL_USER / GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD from the environment (Fly secrets). When
either is missing the send is skipped and False is returned, so callers MUST
treat email as best-effort: the primary work (e.g. persisting a report) must
never depend on, or block on, the result of send_email().

    Send an email to `to`. `body` is the plaintext part; when `html` is provided
    it is added as an HTML alternative (multipart/alternative — clients that can
    render HTML show it, others fall back to `body`).

    `bcc` — blind-copy recipients. They receive the message but are not shown in
    the visible headers (smtplib.send_message delivers to Bcc, then strips the
    header before transmission).

    `attachment_path` — when provided and readable, the file is attached as an
    image (the body stays plain text). A missing/unreadable attachment is logged
    and the email is still sent without it. Returns True on success, False
    otherwise. Never raises — delivery is best-effort and must not break the caller.
