"""
Beta login alerts — ping the founder's phone on every parent login/signup so she
can see who's actively using the app during beta.

Routed through founder_alerts (shared push-first / email-fallback channel), so
there's ONE alert mechanism, not a second Expo integration. Context-aware:
first-ever login reads as a new signup, later logins as returning.

No throttle / cooldown / dedup by design — a deliberate beta stance. Turn it
down after beta with the LOGIN_ALERTS_MODE env var (no code change):
    all               — alert on every login + new signup (default, beta)
    new_signups_only  — only first-ever logins (new signups)
    off               — no login alerts at all

Best-effort and non-blocking: a failed alert must never break or slow a real
login. Callers fire this from a BackgroundTask (runs after the response), and
everything here is additionally wrapped so it can never raise.
