"""
Shared two-layer safety filter for all user-facing AI surfaces.

Layer 1 — input:  check the user's message before calling any model.
Layer 2 — output: check the model's response before showing it to the user.

Both layers must be applied on every surface that returns free-text to a
minor.  Neither layer is gated by a flag or env var — they are always-on.
The model and its prompt rules are a secondary reinforcement, not the floor.
