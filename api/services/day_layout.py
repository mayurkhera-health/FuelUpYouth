"""
Day Layout Engine — Today-tab fuel-window card ordering (Purvi spec).

Produces the ordered card list for a day from its events + resolved activity
types. Reuses window_engine_v2 timing primitives; grams are overlaid downstream.
Replaces window_engine_v2 as the Today-tab window source (behind DAY_LAYOUT_V2).
