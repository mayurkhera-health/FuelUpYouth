"""
Fuel IQ Streak — a genuinely separate streak from api/services/streak_service.py.

That module tracks "did you log a fuel window" (meal confirmations). This one
tracks "did you do something in Fuel IQ" — a lesson completion counts as a
qualifying day. The two are intentionally not conflated: a meal-logging
streak and a learning streak measure different behaviors.

(The Daily Challenge feature has its own separate streak entirely — see
api/services/fueliq_daily_challenge_service.py — deliberately not folded into
this one, since "did you learn a lesson" and "did you do today's daily
challenge" are different habits worth tracking independently.)

current/best streak are always computed live from fueliq_lesson_completions —
never cached — mirroring streak_service's own never-drift guarantee.
fueliq_athlete_progress stores only the non-derivable state (freeze tokens,
last-celebrated milestone), same split as streak_state.
