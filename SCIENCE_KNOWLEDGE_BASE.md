## PART 1 — ENERGY REQUIREMENTS

### RMR Formula (S7 — Everett 2025 — PRIMARY)
```
Girls RMR = 11.1 × wt_kg + 8.4 × ht_cm − 537
Boys  RMR = 11.1 × wt_kg + 8.4 × ht_cm − 340
```
**NEVER use Harris-Benedict for youth athletes.** (S7)
Validated for ages 9–17 by Everett MD 2025, Stony Brook University.

### Total Daily Energy Expenditure
`TDEE = RMR × PAL (Physical Activity Level)`

PAL multipliers validated across S1, S2, S7:
| Activity | PAL |
|----------|-----|
| Rest / light activity | 1.55 |
| Practice / training / strength | 1.85 |
| Game | 2.00 |
| Tournament (multi-game day) | 2.05 |

### Low Energy Availability (LEA) — MEDICAL ALERT
- **Threshold:** < 30 kcal / kg Fat-Free Mass / day (S7, confirmed by multiple sources)
- **FFM estimate:** wt_kg × 0.85 (15% body fat assumption for youth athletes)
- **Clinical evidence:** Even 5 days below threshold causes severe endocrine and metabolic alterations (S7)
- **Prevalence:** LEA is common in youth female soccer players — must screen proactively
- **Action required:** Refer to RD immediately. Use language: *"This is a medical-level concern — please consult a registered dietitian."*

## PART 2 — MACRONUTRIENTS

### Carbohydrates

#### Why carbs are the #1 fuel (S2, S7)
- Muscle glycogen is the most readily available energy source for working muscle
- Released faster than fat or protein during high-intensity intermittent exercise
- Initial muscle glycogen in adolescent soccer: ~134 mmol/kg → drops to ~80 mmol/kg after a simulated match (29% depletion) (MDPI Sports 2025)
- Carbohydrate ingestion increased time to exhaustion by **29%** in adolescent soccer simulations
- **Youth athletes do not meet their daily carbohydrate requirements** — this is the most common fueling gap (research consensus)

#### Carbohydrate targets by event type (S1, S7)
| Event Type | g/kg body weight |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Rest | 4–5 g/kg |
| Practice / Training / Strength | 6–8 g/kg |
| Game | 8–10 g/kg |
| Tournament (multi-game) | 10–12 g/kg |

Percentage of total calories: **45–65%** for ages 4–18 (S5, AAP)

#### Glycogen loading — critical insight (S1, S2, S7)
- Full glycogen replenishment takes **24–48 hours** after depletion
- The pre-game day meal is MORE important than the pre-game meal itself (S1 — Castle)
- **Castle's Rule:** "The night-before pasta dinner matters more than the morning-of breakfast."
- Post-exercise glycogen synthesis is maximized at **1.0–1.2 g/kg carbs every 2 hours for 4–6 hrs** (S7)

### Protein

#### Protein targets by event type (S1, S7)
| Event Type | g/kg body weight |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Rest | 1.2–1.4 g/kg |
| Practice / Training | 1.4–1.6 g/kg |
| Strength training | 1.8–2.0 g/kg |
| Game | 1.6–1.8 g/kg |
| Tournament | 1.8–2.0 g/kg |

Percentage of total calories: **10–30%** for ages 4–18 (S5, AAP)

#### Post-exercise protein timing (S3, S7)
- **20–25g protein within 30 minutes** post-exercise optimizes muscle repair (S3)
- Spread protein evenly across the day — every 3–4 hours (S1 — Castle)
- Don't cluster protein in one meal — distribution matters as much as total intake

### Fat

#### Fat targets (S5, S7)
- **25–35% of total calories** for ages 4–18 (S5, AAP)
- **NEVER restrict fat below 20% in youth athletes** — disrupts hormone production and fat-soluble vitamin (A, D, E, K) absorption (S7 — Everett 2025)
- Fat restriction linked to hormonal dysregulation and increased stress fracture risk in youth (AAP)
- Quality matters: omega-3s (salmon, walnuts, flaxseed) reduce exercise-induced inflammation

## PART 3 — MEAL TIMING (CORE FEATURE)

*Source S3 (The Teenage Athletes' Nutrition Journal) is the primary timing reference.*
*S1 (Castle), S2 (Lair/Murdoch), and S6 (HS Athletes) all confirm the same framework.*

### The Four Pillars of Peak Performance (S3)
1. Energy balance
2. Portion size
3. **Timing of intake** ← most overlooked, most impactful
4. Hydration

### Universal Timing Rules (S1 — Castle, confirmed by S2, S6)
| Window | Rule |
|--------|------|
| 3–4 hrs before activity | Main pre-game/practice meal — carbs + protein, LOW fat |
| 30–60 min before | Light snack only — easy-digest carbs, no heavy food |
| During (>60 min activity) | 15–30g fast carbs every 30–45 min |
| Within 30 min post | Recovery: 3:1 carb-to-protein ratio — CRITICAL WINDOW |
| 2 hrs post | Full recovery meal |

### Pre-Game Meal Rules (S1, S2, S6)
- 2–3 hours minimum before competition for a full meal to digest (S1 — Castle, confirmed by eatright.org)
- HIGH carbs, MODERATE protein, LOW fat and LOW fiber
- Fat and fiber slow gastric emptying — cause discomfort during play
- **Never try new foods on game day** (S1 — Castle's Rule #1)
- Best choices: pasta + lean protein, rice + chicken, toast + eggs

### Pre-Game Snack Rules (S1)
- 30–60 minutes before kickoff
- Easy-digest carbs only: banana, honey toast, rice cakes
- No protein bars, no high-fat foods — stomach needs to be settled
- If athlete is not hungry, banana only or nothing

### Halftime Fuel (S2)
- 15–30g fast-acting carbs
- Orange slices, banana, natural sports drink
- Keep it simple and fast — no solid food that requires digestion time
- Duration < 15 min window means no time for digestion of complex foods

### Post-Exercise Recovery Window (S3, S7 — MOST RESEARCHED)
- The 30-minute anabolic window is real and evidence-backed for youth athletes (S7)
- Target: 1.0–1.2 g/kg carbs + 20–25g protein within 30 min (S3, S7)
- Chocolate milk has the ideal 3:1 carb:protein ratio — most recommended single food for youth recovery (S1, S2)
- Muscle protein synthesis rates are highest immediately post-exercise
- Skipping this window is the single most common nutrition mistake in youth sports (S1 — Castle)

### Multi-Day Event (Tournament) Protocol (S2, S3)
- Eat between games even if not hungry — energy debt compounds (S3)
- Cannot outrun cumulative glycogen depletion across 3–4 games
- Between-game window: immediate recovery food (30 min) → light refuel meal (60–90 min before next game)
- Overnight carb-loading dinner is mandatory for Day 2 performance
- Hydration must be managed proactively — never reactive

### Bedtime Casein Snack (S2, S7)
- Cottage cheese or Greek yogurt before bed on all high-intensity days
- Casein is slow-digesting — feeds muscle repair for 6–8 hours during sleep
- Particularly critical on strength training and tournament days
- Most youth athletes skip this — significant missed recovery opportunity

### Meal Frequency (S3, S6)
- 3 main meals + 2–4 snacks spread across the day
- Never go more than **3–4 hours without eating** during training periods
- Skipping breakfast → running on empty by practice time — most common youth athlete mistake
- Castle's rule: *"Eat every 3–4 hours to optimize growth and athletic development."*

## PART 4 — MICRONUTRIENTS

### Iron (S1, S5, S7 — HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR FEMALE ATHLETES)

#### Targets (AAP/NIH DRI)
- Girls: **15 mg/day** (ages 9–18)
- Boys: **11 mg/day** (ages 9–13), **11 mg/day** (ages 14–18)

#### Why it's critical
- Iron transports oxygen to muscles via hemoglobin (S4, S5)
- **53.2% of female adolescent athletes have mild iron deficiency** (serum ferritin ≤30 µg/L) (PMC 2023)
- Even non-anemic iron deficiency (depleted stores without anemia) impairs endurance, focus, and immune function
- Iron deficiency is the **leading nutritional deficiency in female youth athletes** (S7 — Everett 2025)
- Sports anemia (dilutional) can occur in elite adolescent athletes as adaptation to aerobic training

#### Absorption rules (S2, S7)
- Pair iron-rich foods with Vitamin C — increases non-heme iron absorption significantly
- Avoid consuming calcium-rich foods within 1 hour of iron-rich meals — calcium blocks iron absorption
- Vitamin C sources: orange juice, bell peppers, strawberries, citrus
- Best food sources: lean red meat (grass-fed), spinach + lemon, lentils + hummus, fortified cereals (no artificial dyes)

#### Urgency level in app
- Girls: **CRITICAL** — non-negotiable flag
- Boys: **IMPORTANT** — monitor and address

### Calcium (S5, S7)

#### Target
- **1,300 mg/day ALL athletes ages 9–17** (AAP)

#### Why it's critical
- Ages 9–17 is the single most critical window for peak bone mass accumulation (AAP, S5, S7)
- This window never repeats — inadequate calcium in adolescence = reduced bone density for life
- Calcium absorption requires Vitamin D — the two work as a pair
- Stress fractures in youth athletes are frequently linked to inadequate calcium + Vitamin D (S7)
- Best sources: milk, yogurt, cheese, fortified plant milk, cottage cheese, broccoli + kale

### Magnesium (S7, NIH DRI)

#### Targets (NIH DRI)
- Ages 9–13 (all genders): **240 mg/day**
- Girls 14+: **360 mg/day**
- Boys 14+: **410 mg/day**

#### Why it matters
- Involved in >300 enzymatic reactions including ATP energy production
- Essential for muscle contraction AND relaxation
- **Muscle cramps in youth athletes are frequently low magnesium, not just dehydration**
- Youth athletes frequently deficient, especially during growth spurts
- Absorption improves with Vitamin B6-rich foods (chicken, bananas, potatoes)
- Excess calcium can compete with magnesium absorption — spread throughout the day
- Best sources: pumpkin seeds, almonds, cashews, spinach, edamame, dark chocolate (70%+, no artificial dyes), black beans, lentils

### Vitamin D (S5, S7, Boston Children's Hospital)

#### Target
- **1,000 IU/day** for all youth athletes (Boston Children's Hospital recommendation)
- Minimum: 600 IU/day (AAP dietary minimum — insufficient for athletes)

#### Why it matters
- Required for calcium absorption — without adequate Vitamin D, calcium cannot build bone (S5, S7)
- Supports muscle power output and immune function
- Deficiency is extremely common — especially indoor athletes, northern climates (S7)
- Fat-soluble vitamin — must be taken with dietary fat for absorption (avocado, olive oil, nuts)
- Best sources: salmon, tuna, fortified milk, egg yolks, fortified OJ (no artificial dyes), UV-exposed mushrooms

## PART 5 — HYDRATION

### General Targets (S1, S2, S4)
| Activity | Daily Target |
|----------|-------------|
| Rest | 64–72 oz |
| Practice / Training / Strength | 72–80 oz |
| Game | 80–88 oz |
| Tournament | 88–96 oz |

### During Exercise (S1 — Castle, confirmed by S2)
- **~½ cup (4 oz) every 15 minutes** during activity (Castle)
- Pre-event: 16–20 oz in the 2–4 hours before activity
- Post-event: replace all sweat losses — weigh before/after if possible (1 lb lost = ~16 oz needed)
- Best drink for <60 min activity: **water** (S2, S5)
- For >60 min: natural sports drink without artificial dyes acceptable (S1, S2)

### Sports Drink Warning (S1, S2, S7)
- **Avoid Red #40, Yellow #5, Yellow #6** in all sports drinks and food
- Behavioral concerns linked to artificial dyes in children (FDA review ongoing)
- Natural alternatives: coconut water, watermelon juice, homemade electrolyte water (water + salt + citrus + honey)
- Energy drinks: **contraindicated for all youth athletes** — caffeine, taurine, and stimulants are not safe for developing cardiovascular systems (S7 — Everett 2025)

### Sweat Profile (S2)
Sweat rate increases with age and training level. Key factors: age, sex, competition level, heat/humidity.
- Ages ≤11: Light sweater
- Ages 12–13: Moderate sweater
- Ages 14–15: Heavy sweater
- Ages 16+ (boys in particular): Very heavy sweater
- Elite/competitive level bumps one tier up
- Heat + humidity adds ~20% to fluid requirements

## PART 6 — SPECIAL TOPICS

### Food-First Approach (S7 — Everett 2025 — CORE PRINCIPLE)
The review explicitly advocates for a **food-first approach** before any supplementation.
Whole foods provide synergistic nutrients that isolated supplements cannot replicate.
- Iron from food (heme iron from meat) is better absorbed than supplements
- Calcium from dairy includes cofactors that enhance bone metabolism
- Vitamin D from fortified foods comes with other fat-soluble vitamins

### Supplements (S7 — Everett 2025 Policy)
- Review evaluates creatine, caffeine, and energy drinks
- **Conclusion: Not appropriate for adolescent athletes**
- Creatine: insufficient safety data for youth under 18
- Caffeine: cardiovascular risk in developing athletes; contraindicated
- Energy drinks: explicitly contraindicated — multiple adverse event reports in youth
- **FuelUp policy: No supplements recommended. Food-first. RD referral for any supplement questions.**

### Tournament / Multi-Day Event Nutrition (S2, S3)
- Most neglected area in youth sports nutrition
- Between-game nutrition is qualitatively different from single-game nutrition
- Cumulative glycogen depletion is the primary performance limiter across a tournament
- Recovery speed between games is almost entirely nutritional — not fitness-based at the youth level
- Castle's tournament rule: *"Eat between games even when not hungry. By the time you feel it, you've already lost the third game."*

### Growth and Development Context (S1, S5, S7)
- Youth athletes are growing AND training — energy needs are HIGHER than adults per kg
- Growth spurts can increase nutrient demands by 20–30% above baseline calculations
- Never put youth athletes on caloric restriction — even small deficits disrupt growth plates and hormonal development
- Adolescent girls: hormone disruption from energy restriction can cause menstrual irregularities and long-term bone damage (S7 — Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport / RED-S)

### Parent + Athlete Dual Communication Model (S1, S6)
Castle's framework (confirmed by S6) explicitly distinguishes parent and athlete messaging:
- **Parents** need: science rationale, specific numbers, safety alerts, actionable instructions
- **Athletes** need: performance framing (not health framing), age-appropriate language, short actionable cues, peer-relevant examples
- Messaging around weight or body composition: **avoid entirely** for athletes under 18
- Motivation angle for teens: speed, strength, endurance — not calories or weight

## PART 7 — PRACTICAL RULES FOR AI PROMPTS

When writing Claude prompts or app copy, apply these rules derived from all 7 sources:

### The 10 Non-Negotiable Rules
1. **Never Harris-Benedict** — Everett 2025 RMR formula only (S7)
2. **Never restrict fat below 20%** — hormone disruption risk (S7, AAP)
3. **Never recommend supplements** — food-first, RD referral (S7)
4. **Never recommend energy drinks or caffeine** — contraindicated for all youth (S7)
5. **Iron is CRITICAL for girls** — 53.2% deficiency rate, flag aggressively (S7)
6. **Pre-game day > pre-game day** — glycogen takes 24–48 hrs, the night-before meal matters more (S1, S2)
7. **30-minute recovery window is non-negotiable** — chocolate milk + banana is the gold standard (S1, S2, S3)
8. **LEA < 30 kcal/kg FFM = medical alert** — refer to RD, do not minimize (S7)
9. **Never try new foods on game day** — Castle's Rule #1 (S1)
10. **Food-first, always** — whole foods before any supplement consideration (S7 — Everett 2025)

### The 4 Pillars (S3 — Teenage Athletes' Nutrition Journal)
All app features should map to one of these pillars:
1. **Energy balance** → Blueprint, daily targets, calorie tracking
2. **Portion size** → Meal planner, recipe DB
3. **Timing of intake** → Today tab, meal timeline, schedule-based calculations
4. **Hydration** → Hydration screen, sweat profile

### Messaging Do's and Don'ts (S1, S4, S6)
| ✅ DO | ❌ DON'T |
|------|--------|
| Frame food as fuel for performance | Frame food as calorie counting |
| Use speed/strength/endurance language for teens | Mention weight or body composition to teens |
| Give parents specific grams and numbers | Give parents vague "eat healthy" advice |
| Reference timing windows | Make food seem complicated |
| Use relatable athlete examples (S4 — Rau) | Use adult athlete examples for youth |
| Acknowledge growth context | Treat youth like small adults |
